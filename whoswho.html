		<p class="whoswho">I'm Mostafa here is some information about me:
Born in 2007 21th October.
UI designer and scripter with few month of experience.
I hate these sites that requires phone number and it was the reason how i lost my main account.
I born in Egypt, Minya, Matai city.
4-5 Hours active in Discord.
First time i joined Roblox was in 2017.
First time started developing was in 2023 September.
My Roblox account is very safe since the password contains 1000 characters
Why did i join this community. Well it's a long story
I was in a Group that was working on a game. I was the founder of the Group and the Group was destroyed all because of a 9-10 years old guy called Filles in early 2024. And he stole lots of my developers and i gave the ownership to the community manager and somehow i got to Filles' group and found too many developers of us was working with him and after i asked them why i started getting attacked and the community manager or you can say the owner kicked me because i asked them why and they left so i was looking for job and found you guys in a server called "roblox scripters" then i applied to become a developer. That's the story.</p>
