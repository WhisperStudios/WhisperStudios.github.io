            <h4 class="whoswho">Homeless | _deeznuts_</h4>
            <p class="whoswho">I'm Mostafa. Here is some information about me: Born in 2007 on the 21st of October. UI designer and scripter with a few months of experience. I hate these sites that require a phone number, and it was the reason how I lost my main account. I was born in Egypt, Minya, Matai city. I'm active on Discord for 4-5 hours daily. First time I joined Roblox was in 2017. First time I started developing was in September 2023. My Roblox account is very safe since the password contains 1000 characters. Why did I join this community? Well, it's a long story. I was in a group that was working on a game. I was the founder of the group, and the group was destroyed all because of a 9-10 year old guy called Filles in early 2024. He stole lots of my developers, and I gave the ownership to the community manager. Somehow, I got to Filles' group and found too many developers of ours working with him. After I asked them why, I started getting attacked and the community manager, or you can say the owner, kicked me because I asked them why, and they left. So I was looking for a job and found you guys in a server called "Roblox Scripters." Then I applied to become a developer. That's the story.</p>
